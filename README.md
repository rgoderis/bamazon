### View Product Sales by Department
This joins the products and departments tables and displays departments.department_id, departments.department, departments.over_head_costs, products.product_sales, and creates a temporary column of total_profit.  over_head_costs displays the total overhead cost of each department, product_sales is the calculated total of the total sales by each department, total_profit is calculated by subtracting over_head_costs from product_sales.

### Create New Department
This prompts the user to add to the departments table by entering **department** and **over_head_costs**.
This then will update the possible selection of departments available when the bamazonManager enters a new product.
